ðŸ“Š AD Performance Analysis using Power BI
ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Ad Performance Analysis Dashboard is a powerful and interactive solution built in Power BI to analyze and optimize multi-platform advertising campaigns. It brings together 2,000 rows of campaign data from multiple sources and transforms them into clear, actionable insights. By leveraging slicers, users can quickly filter and focus on specific campaign types, platforms, regions, or audience segments. The dashboard also employs conditional formatting to highlight high-performing areas and detect underperforming ones, ensuring that critical patterns stand out instantly.

ðŸŒŸ What It Does
The dashboard offers a comprehensive performance overview by tracking impressions (43M), clicks (2M), conversions (413K), and ROI (276.37%). It compares results across multiple campaign types â€” including Brand Awareness, Website Traffic, Engagement, Lead Generation, and Video Views â€” allowing stakeholders to identify the most effective strategies.

Region-wise analysis covers Latin America, Asia-Pacific, North America, Europe, and Middle East & Africa, enabling geographic performance benchmarking. Audience insights dive into age groups (Young, Adult, Senior) and gender targeting to understand reach and engagement at a demographic level.

ðŸ“± Platform Performance
Performance is analyzed across leading digital platforms â€” Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube. The dashboard highlights which platforms drive the highest revenue and which maintain the best click-through rates (CTR), empowering marketing teams to focus on channels that deliver the strongest ROI.

By combining dynamic filtering, time-based comparisons, and visual storytelling, it allows marketing teams, data analysts, and business leaders to make informed, data-backed choices.
